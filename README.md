# interactive-pricing-component
An interactive pricing component project from frontendmentor.io

I designed this interactive pricing component following the design picture I found on frontendmentor.io
The pricing component works with javascript, so you can change the price of the "service" and also add or remove the discount,
clicking the switch button below the price bar.

The design is fully responsive. I used media queries to make the design as close as possibile to the one I had to copy from 
frontendmentor.

I hope you like my work.

Cheers
